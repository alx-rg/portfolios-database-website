# Portfolio for CS/Eng Professionals
Professional CS/ENG portfolios are just too complicated and take too long to read. Most people going through resumes have a few seconds to a minute to make a judgement call on your competences. This easy to read and simple portfolio website allows you, teachers, and recruiters to quickly see what's most important and if you're a good fit.
